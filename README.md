# miv.vim

Markdown in Vim.


*Reason*

Though rst in vim [Riv.vim](https://github.com/Rykka/riv.vim) is enough for writing.

but rst does not support javascript, which is a BIG disadvantage.

Haven't start working yet, So any suggestion are welcome.

You can post issues at github or email me at rykka@foxmail.com.

I thought I should use javascript lib to finish it.

Though vim does not support native scripting is a BIG disadvantage.
